## USBH ReEnumerate

In order to prevent a semi-rare bug where removing a USB drive would not result in the "Disconnect_Callback" being called appropriately, the USBH_ReEnumerate() function in usbh_core.c was edited.

The edit removes the check for  USBH_IsPortEnabled() before ttriggering a disconnection/reinitialization.

This will allow reconnection via ReEnumeration when this bug takes place. Otherwise, a power cycle/reset was necessary to restore USB Host functionality to the application.
